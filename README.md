# Accenture Data Analytics and Visualization Job Simulation

## Project Overview
This repository contains the work completed during the Accenture Data Analytics and Visualization Job Simulation on Forage. The project focuses on analyzing user engagement within an application by working with three datasets: Content, Reaction, and Reaction Types. The goal was to clean, model, and visualize the data to uncover insights into app usage patterns and user preferences.

## Project Understanding
- Data Cleaning & Modeling: 
  - Removed irrelevant columns and rows from the datasets to ensure clean and accurate data.
  - Focused on key columns that provided meaningful insights into user behavior.
- Data Visualization & Storytelling: 
  - Used visualization techniques to identify trends, such as the month with the highest app usage and the content category with the best scores.
  - Created a clear narrative around the data insights to effectively communicate findings to stakeholders.
- Present to the Client: 
  - Developed a comprehensive dashboard that summarizes the key insights and presents them in an easy-to-understand format for the client.

## Details
- Datasets: 
  - Content Dataset: Contains information about the different types of content available in the app.
  - Reaction Dataset: Includes data on user reactions to the content.
  - Reaction Types Dataset: Provides details about the types of reactions users can give.
- Key Steps:
  - Data Cleaning: Removed unnecessary data points to focus on the most relevant information.
  - Data Analysis: Conducted a thorough analysis of the cleaned data to identify key trends.
  - Data Visualization: Created visual representations of the data to highlight important insights.
- Key Insights:
  - Identified the month with the highest app usage.
  - Determined the content category that received the highest user engagement scores.
